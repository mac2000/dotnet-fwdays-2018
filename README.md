# I build an app

So here we go, I have build an awesome dotnet core app.

To run it, just clone repository and `dotnet run` it.

You gonna see conference logo, host name at top left and current time on a server at top right corners.

At bottom there is few demo buttons to play with

Ping do nothing - just to check that app is still alive

Load CPU - will load one core for ten seconds

Both exit buttons will exit app with acccording exit code
